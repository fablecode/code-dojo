# Code Dojo

Welcome to the Code Dojo! This repository is a collection of coding katas and exercises designed to improve your coding skills and promote Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. 

## What is a Code Kata?

A code kata is a short coding exercise that helps you practice your problem-solving skills and refine your coding techniques. In the Code Dojo, you'll find a variety of katas covering different algorithms, data structures, and programming concepts.

## Why TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a powerful approach to software development that emphasizes writing tests before writing code. By following TDD principles, you'll learn how to write more reliable and maintainable code while gaining confidence in your solutions.

## How to Use This Repository

Each kata comes with a set of instructions and accompanying test cases. Start by selecting a kata of your choice and read through the instructions. Then, write your solution using TDD practices, aiming to make all the test cases pass. Feel free to explore different programming languages and techniques.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the Code Dojo! If you have a new kata or an improvement to an existing one, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the established format and provide clear instructions and test cases.
